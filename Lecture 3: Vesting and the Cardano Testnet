This lecture will also explore the Cardano Testnet
##Script Context
data ScriptContext:- have two constractors
  1)ScriptContextTxInfo :: TxInfo
                 TxInfo constractors :- 
                 A pending transaction. This is the view as seen by validator scripts,
                 so some details are stripped out
                                    txInfoInputs :: [TxInInfo] => Transaction inputs
                                    txInfoOutputs :: [TxOut] => Transaction outputs
                                    txInfoFee :: Value => The fee paid by this transaction.
                                    txInfoMint :: Value => The Value minted by this transaction.
                                    txInfoDCert :: [DCert] => Digests of certificates included in this transaction
                                    txInfoWdrl :: [(StakingCredential, Integer)] => Withdrawals
                                    txInfoValidRange :: POSIXTimeRange => The valid range for the transaction.
                                    txInfoSignatories :: [PubKeyHash] => Signatures provided with the transaction,
                                                                         attested that they all signed the tx
                                    txInfoData :: [(DatumHash, Datum)]
                                    txInfoId :: TxId  Hash of the pending transaction (excluding witnesses)
                                    
  2)ScriptContextPurpose ::ScriptPurpose :- Purpose of the script that is currently running:-
                                          Minting CurrencySymbol,
                                          Spending TxOutRef,
                                          Rewarding StakingCredential,
                                          Certifying DCert

## Handling Time
We want to be able to express validation logic that says that a certain transaction is only valid 
after a certain time has been reached or before a certain time has been reached. 

type POSIXTimeRange = Interval POSIXTime
An Interval of POSIXTimes.

Where Interval is:- have Constructors => ivFrom :: LowerBound a ->The lower bound of an interval. &
                                         ivTo :: UpperBound a -> The upper bound of an interval.
                    Where Lower Bound is: have Constructors => LowerBound (Extended a) Closure
                                        Where Closure is:  Whether a bound is inclusive or not.
                                        Where Extended is: A set extended with a positive and negative infinity.
